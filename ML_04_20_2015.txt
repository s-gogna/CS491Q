Goal: Construct a projection that maintains (or preservers) distance
  1. Define distance
  2. Define an object that captures distance info in input space
  3. Repeat step 2 for output space. This is a function of the projected points.
  4. Optimize to make A and B close
KL( P, Q ) = integ( P * log(P/Q) )    // P, Q are probability distributions (Gaussians)
  2'. Define a probability distribution over pair of points such that 
    - Points that are close have high prob.
    - Points that are far have low prob.
For Wed/Fri:
  Do t-SNE (in manifold package) with MNIST data
