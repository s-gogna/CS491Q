CNNs
Dropout
	Features should no correlate to each other (ideally)
	Features should correlate to labels (ideally)
	1. Compute the activation of neuron1 and neuron2
	2. Flip a coin for each neuron deciding if the activation should be zeroed
		when it is forwarded
	Torch: nn.Dropout(0.5)
	DropConnect: connections/weights dropped
Validation Sets
	[Training Set|Test Set]
	In the past, training done on the entire set, but this causes overconfidence
		in the system because it has already seen the input and output.
	Systems need to be able to generalize to unseen inputs.
	[Training Set|Validation Set|Test Set]
	Training with training. Optimize with validation. Evaluate with test.
	K-Fold Cross Validation
