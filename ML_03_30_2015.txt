Convolution Neural Net
Convolve mask with image to get new image.
Edges can be handled in different ways.

Convolution Layer
Input -> Convolution Layer -> Subsample (image half of its resolution, nxn -> n/2 x n/2)
Big -> Smaller makes training more stable.
Nonlinearity thrown in because convolution is a linear operator.

Input -> Convolution Layer 1 -> Convolution Layer 2 -> Neural Net -> Output
After a string of convolutions, you flatten your images and continue with a neural net.

Spacial L2 Pooling: Calculating L2 norm and doing something with it.

By next class, implement Convolutional NN with MNIST.
