Discriminitive Model
  Map inputs to labels
  x_vec -> linear -> ReLU -> ... -> Softmax y (Labels)
  p(y | x_vec)
Generative Model
  Represents the joint distribution between inputs and labels: p(x_vec,y)
  p(x_vec, y) -> p(x_vec), p(y) using marginalization
  Can eventually be used to get p(y | x_vec)
General Graph
  Two connected nodes represent a relationship of the random variables
  Two unconnected nodes represent independence of the random variables
Restricted Boltzman Machine (RBM)
  Each visible node is connected to each hidden node
  Visible nodes are independent of each other
  Hidden nodes are independent of each other
  Training algorithm = Contrastive Divergence
  Binary-Binary RBM
  Gaussian-Binary RBM
