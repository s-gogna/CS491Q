Probability Distributions
	Discrete: Defined by a probability mass function PMF denoted by P(X) or P(X=x)
		X is the RV. x is a possible value.
		x = heads (1) or tails (0), P(X=1) = probability of heads
		P(X=1) = 1/2 means coin is fair
		Joint Distribution of X and Y is given by P(X=x, Y=y)
		Rules for PMFs: 
			Sum of x in X of f(x) equals 1
			f(x) is in the set of 0 and 1 inclusive and
			f has to cover all possible values of x
			Discrete Uniform Random Variable: P(X=xi) = 1/k if x is in the set {x1,x2,x3,...,xk}
	Continuous:
		Probability density instead of mass
		Rules for PDFs:
			Integral of p(x)dx is 1
			dom(p) = possible values of X
			For all x, p(x) >= 0, p(x) > 1 is allowed
		Probability that X falls in [a,b] is integral(b to a) of p(x)dx
		Roughly p(x)dx is the probability that X fall in an interval centered on x, of width dx. (if dx is infinitesimal)
		Ex: Continuous Uniform RV
			Suppose b > a. Then define
			u(x; a,b) = { 0 if x is not in the set of a, b
						{ 1/b-a if x is in the set of [a,b]
