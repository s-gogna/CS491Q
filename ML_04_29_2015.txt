{ X_t } t = 1 -> infinity
Possible tasks:
  1. Classify the whole sequence
  2. Predict future X_t's
  3. Characterize distribution of X_t's in some way
1D Convolution over time to combine information in a way that is useful in combining data
Number of sequence items dependent on the input data/sequence
  Ex: A cat's actions won't always be 3 frames of a video
Input gate: if the input gate is turned off, we ignore the input
Output gate: if the output gate is turned off, we stop any output
Recurrent connection: loops back into the cell
Forget gate: if forget is set, we lose the information from the recurrent connection
LSTM: Long Short Term Memory
Google:
  Convolution of 1 frame -> multiple LSTM nodes -> Softmax
  Convolution of 1 frame -> multiple LSTM nodes (that also take the inputs of the LSTM from previous frame) -> Softmax
  Convolution weights are shared among frames
Time has to be modeled if you want to remember stuff
